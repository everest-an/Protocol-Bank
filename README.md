# Protocol Bank

## Overview

Protocol Bank is a cutting-edge digital banking platform designed to revolutionize global payments by seamlessly integrating traditional fiat services with the innovative world of cryptocurrencies. Positioned as a blockchain-based competitor to SWIFT, Protocol Bank aims to address the inefficiencies, high costs, and lack of transparency prevalent in existing cross-border payment systems.

## Problems Solved

Traditional global payment systems, such as SWIFT, are often characterized by:

*   **High Fees:** Multiple intermediary banks lead to cumulative transaction costs.
*   **Slow Settlement Times:** Payments can take days to clear due to batch processing and fragmented national systems.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** Senders and receivers have limited visibility into payment status and deducted fees.
*   **Operational & Compliance Overhead:** Complex relationships and pre-funding requirements for financial institutions.

Protocol Bank directly tackles these issues by offering a decentralized, efficient, and transparent alternative.

## Key Features

*   **Dual Fiat and Cryptocurrency Support:** Seamlessly manage both traditional currencies and digital assets.
*   **Global Payment Network Integration:** Direct integration with major clearing networks like CHIPS, CHAPS, Fedwire, TARGET2, and CIPS for rapid cross-border transactions.
*   **Automated DeFi Lending:** Leverage decentralized finance for automated lending and borrowing.
*   **Automated Payment Splitting:** Businesses can automatically split payments for suppliers and vendors, optimizing supply chain finance.
*   **Streaming Payments:** Enable real-time, continuous payments for freelancers and subscription services.
*   **Facial Recognition Login & KYC Integration:** Enhanced security and streamlined user onboarding with advanced biometric authentication and regulatory compliance.
*   **NFC Contactless Payments:** Modern and convenient payment options.
*   **Solana & Ethereum Compatibility:** Primary deployment on Solana for speed and low fees, with cross-chain bridge capabilities and EIP protocol support for Ethereum compatibility.
*   **Virtual Master Accounts with Real Sub-Accounts:** Optimize tax and financial management for individuals and businesses.

## Technical Overview

Protocol Bank is built with a robust and scalable architecture:

*   **Frontend:** React.js with a minimalist UI design (inspired by mirror.xyz and N26), utilizing Aeonik font and a white/gray/frosted glass color palette.
*   **Backend:** Flask RESTful API with PostgreSQL database for persistent storage and Redis caching for performance.
*   **Blockchain:** Solana-based smart contracts for core logic, with ERC-20 and DeFi proxy contracts on Ethereum to ensure dual-chain compatibility and broader ecosystem access.
*   **Security:** JWT authentication (EdDSA/ES256), Multi-factor authentication (MFA), facial recognition with liveness detection, NFC payment system, and device fingerprinting.
*   **Messaging:** ISO 20022 standard for financial messaging, ensuring interoperability with traditional systems.
